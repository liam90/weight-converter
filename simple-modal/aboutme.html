        <p>I love that feeling of grinding through a problem and then that aha moment hits, 
          and you’re the smartest version of you that you’ve ever been… till a few moments 
          later you come down and have to think through how the solution really is the solution… ahh coding, am I right !</p>
        <p>Funny enough I was not always a tech person, but about 6 years back while on break
          at one of those dead ends I use to call a job I seen an advertisement for free
          lessons on how to code(the site was freecodecamp.com excellent resource) and from there
          I feel in love ! Coding is not just a hobby or something to fun to do or a way to make
          money to keep the lights on, to me its a passion. From building sites to making little games
          for my niece and nephews and of course the occasional family member asking to me to fix the
          internet connection because I’m now the family tech support. To the point I have always
          have code/coding challenges I’m facing just running in the background of my mind this often
          leads me to solve my coding problem, while I’m jogging, playing basketball, watching physics
          documentaries, or cooking breakfast. I'll figure out the answer then rush to my computer to see it work.</p>
        <p>My name is Liam Mandeville, I’m passionate, disciplined, logical and thoughtful of the things I do,
          passionate about creating community within the tech space, And a passionate software engineer who
          will do whatever it takes to get to that aha moment.</p>
        <p>I look forward to connecting and find the next answer(s) together</p>
